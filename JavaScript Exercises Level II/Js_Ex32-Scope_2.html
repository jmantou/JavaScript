	<h1>Level II - Ex 32 Variable Scope with let & const</h1>
	<h2>The <code>let</code> Keyword</h2>
	<p>
		The <code>let</code> keyword for declaring variables was introduced in Javascript ES6. Variables declared
		inside curly braces ({ }) with 'let' can have block scope and cannot be accessed from outside this block.
		As we already mentioned varables declared with the <code>var</code> keyword can not have block scope, thus 
		they can be accessed from outside the block. Redeclaring a variable using <code>var</code> can lead to problems
		because if the variable is inside a block, the variable will be redeclared and outside of this block. We can solve
		this problem using the <code>let</code> keyword.
	</p>
	<h2>The <code>const</code> Keyword</h2>
	<p>
		Variables defined with <code>const</code> cannot be redeclared and reassigned. They also have block scope.
		JavaScript <code>const</code> variables must be assigned a value when they are declared. As a general rule, 
		always declare variables with <code>const</code> unless you know that the value will change.
	</p>
	<p>We very often use <code>const</code> when we want to declare:</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>A new Array</li>
			<li>A new Object</li>
			<li>A new Function</li>
			<li>A new RegExp</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
<p><em>NOTE:The keyword <code>const does not exactly defines a constant value, but a constant reference
	to a value. As a result we can change a constant array and an object defined with <code>const</code>.
	However we cannot reassigned the array.
</code></em></p>
