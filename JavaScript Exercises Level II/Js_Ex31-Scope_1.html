	<h1>Level II - Ex 31 Variable Scope</h1>
	<p>
		In general when the scope of the variable in JavaScript refers to the portions of the program where it
		can be directly accessed. Before ES^ (2015) edition variables intriduced with the <code>var</code> 
		keyword had only <strong>Global Scope</strong> and <strong>Function Scope.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		As we will see in the next exercise JavaScript ES6 introduced <strong>Block Scope.</strong>Variables 
		declared inside a { } block cannot be aqccessed from outside the block. Variables declared with the 
		<code>var</code> keyword cannot have block scope.
