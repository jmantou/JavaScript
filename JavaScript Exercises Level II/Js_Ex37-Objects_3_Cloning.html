	<h1>Level II - Ex 37 Objects 3 Comparing and Cloning Objects</h1>
	<h2>Comparing Objects</h2>
	<p>
		Since equality operators <code>==</code> or <code>===</code> work solely on primitive values, you cannot use them to compare objects because they do nothing more than compare the <em>reference</em> contained to those objects. If you want to examine if two objects contain the same members, you have to do a careful inspection of each and look at each member individually with a loop.  
	</p>
	<h2>Cloning Objects</h2>
	<p>
		Simply assigning objects to another variable does not make a complete duplicate of that object. If you want to clone it (that is make a disconnected copy or <em>deep</em> copy) you have to go to considerable effort to make sure that every member is individually copied from one object to another.

// Assigning a clone method to Object.prototype
Object.prototype.clone = function() {
	var objClone = new Object();

const shallowClonedObject = oldObject;
const deepClonedObject = oldObject.clone();
oldObject.name = "Nick";

// If clonedObject was just a reference to oldObject, then this would output “Nick”:
document.write(`<br/>${deepClonedObject.name}`); // "John"
document.write(`<br/>${shallowClonedObject.name}`); // "Nick"
