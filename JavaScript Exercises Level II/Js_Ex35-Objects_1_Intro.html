	<h1>Level II - Ex 35 Objects 1</h1>
	<p>
		In Javascript an Object is a container of properties, where a property has a name and a value.
		In JavaScript, arrays is a special kind of object, functions are objects, regular expressions
		are objects and, of course, objects are objects.
	</p>
	<p>
		At their core objects are containers storing related data and functionality. Objects in JaObjects can contain other objects so they can easily represent more complex data structures like trees and graphs.
	</p>
	<h2>Object Literals</h2>
	<p>
		It is the simplest way to create an object. An object literal can be created as a pair of curly braces ({ }) containing zero or more name/value pairs. A value in an object can be updated directly by assignment. If the property name is already there, the value of the property is replaced with the new one.
