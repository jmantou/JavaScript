	<h1>Level II - Ex 39 Objects 5 Destructuring</h1>
	<h2>Object Destructuring</h2>
	<p>
		Destructuring assignment allows you to locally scope fields of an object and
		declare which values will be used. We can scope some of the keys of an object 
		locally and use them as variables.
	</p>
	<h2>Array Destructuring</h2>
	<p>
		We can also destructure values from arrays (they are objects after all). We 
		can also pass over unnecessary array values with 'list matching' using commas.
		That means that commas will take the place of elements that should be skipped.
	</p>

// bread and meat are now local variables out of the original object.
// This variables are local (if we use let) so we can change them without
// affecting the 'sandwich' object.
