	    <h1>JavaScript Exercise 10 - Do .. . While Loops</h1>
		<p>
			Whenever we want a specific piece of code to run many times, or want to work sequentially on each element of an array or object we use loops. Loops most of the time run until a condition is met. This is especially the case with <code>do ...while</code> loops that has some differences with simple <code>while</code> loops.
		</p>
		<p>
			The imporatant difference between <code>while</code> and <code>do ...while</code> loops involves how the Boolean expression that controls the loop is checked. With a <code>do ...while</code> statement, the body of the loop is executed first and the Boolean expression is checked <em>after</em> the loop body is executed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus, the <code>do ... while</code> statement always executes at least once. After this these two types of loops behave the same. After each iteration of the body of the loop, the expression is checked again, and if is <em>true</em>, the loop continues. If it has changed from <em>true</em> to <em>false</em> the loop statement ends.
		</p>
		<p>We also introduce in this loop the <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> 
			statements that can be use with all kinds of loops and block statements.
