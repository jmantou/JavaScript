    <h1>JavaScript Exercise 27 - Simple App for Painting a Room</h1>
    <p>
        Write a simple program that computes the money we will spend painting our room given that we need 1kg 
        of paint for every 4 m<sup>2</sup> wall area. You have to also compute the remaining paint. The user will
        insert from keyboard the area and the cost for 1 kg of paint.
    </p>

<script>
var area = prompt("Enter room area: ");
var price = prompt("Enter paint price per Kg: ");
var boxes = area / 4;

if ((area % 4) != 0)
{
    boxes++;
}
var bill = boxes * price;
document.write("Total Amount = " + boxes + " Kg | Cost = " + bill + " â‚¬ <br/>");

var leftover = boxes - area / 4;
document.write("Paint Left Over = " + leftover + "Kg <br/>");
