	    <h1>JavaScript Exercise 15 - Simple Sequential Algorithm</h1>
		<p>
			It has been proved in theoritical computer science that all NP - Complete algorithms can be
			implemented with three basic structures:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sequential Command execution</li>
			<li>Logical Conditions (if ... else) </li>
			<li>Iterations & Loops</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			 The next exercise is a simple algorithm that can be implemented with a sequential solution. 
			 It is amazing how many problems we can solve with just simple sequential algorithms.
		</p>
		<h2>Exercise - Gross and Net Earnings</h2>
		<p>Create a program in JavaScript that reads the day salary, workdays and extra work hours of an
			employee for a given month and computes the gross income and NET income for this month. 
			We also state that 20% is deducted every month from the salary with additional 5% state taxes. 
			Moreover the company pays every extra working hour with 15% of the day salary. 
		</p>
