	    <h1>JavaScript Exercise 7 - Simple Weight App with If Statements</h1>
		<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
		<p>This is a Javascript simple app that after taking the weight and height as input from the user,
			computes the DMS of this person and categorizes the individual.</p> 
		<p>The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize the student with if ... else statement.
			In this level of exercises the app is not sanitizing the input from the user, that is 
		checking for negative or extreme values and the right age. This will be done in a later revision of the app after we learn loops and data cleaning.</p>
