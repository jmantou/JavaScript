		<h1>JavaScript Exercise 16 - Functions Part I</h1>
		
		<p>
			Functions are an elemental concept in all computer languages. A function encloses
			a set of statements as a modular unit. Functions in JavaScript are used for code reuse, information
			hiding and composition. Generally, the craft of programming is athe factoring of a set of
			requirements into a set of functions and data structures.
		</p>
		<p>
			All functions in Javascript are first class objects, meaning they can be passed around like any
			other object reference. Regardless of how they are created, functions are instances of a global
			object named <code>Function</code>. This means that every function will have access to certain
			methods and properties.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once we define a function, we can assign it to a variable, just like any value. This is called
			a <em>Function Literal</em>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to execute the function code we have to invoke the
			function. We do this by simply calling the function with it's name and a set of parenthesis.
		</p>
		<p>
			Functions can also take one or more parameters in their function definition. These arguments
			are listed inside the parenthesis () in the function definition.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the function body, the arguments (parameters) behave as if they were local variables and 
			can be manipulated inside the function.
		</p>
		<p>
			From ES6 onwards we can declare default parameters as arguments in functions. we can also pass an entire object
			instead of strings in default parameters.
