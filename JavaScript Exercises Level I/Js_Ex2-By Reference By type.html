    <h1>Level I - Ex 2 - Primitive & By Reference Data Types v1</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript there are six primitive data types: Number, Primitive, 
        Boolean, Null, Symbol and Undefined. They are called <em>Primitive</em> 
    because they cannot be reduced in more fundamental building blocks.
    </p>
    <p>The <em>Reference</em> data types are composite types because they
    can contain both primitive and other composite types. Composite types
    build on a fundamental building-block type in JavaScript called
    <em>Object</em>, a flexible collection of diverse types with any 
        number of different members.</p>
    <p>The basic data types fall into 2 groups based on the way they store
        their information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Primitive Types - Their value is stored directly into a 
            memory location assigned for that identifier.</li>
        <li>Reference Types - A Reference to a memory location containing
            the data for the object is assigned to the identifier.</li>
    </ul>
