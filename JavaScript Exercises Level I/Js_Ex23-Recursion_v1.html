    <h1>Level I - Ex 23 - Using Recursion ver 1</h1>
    <p>
         <strong>Recursion</strong> is a basic programming technique in which a function calls itself
         repeatedly to solve a problem. Many programming problems and algorithms can be solved this way
         and some problems that can be solved by other techniques are better solved by recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept of recursion can be difficult at times and many programmers try to avoid it if
        they can. But some programming problems can be solved very efficiently with recursion and with
        more cost-effective algorithms.

    <h3>Calculating the Factorial of a Number</h3>
    <p>
        The calculation of a number factorial is a classic example for introducing recursion. 
        The <em>Factorial</em> of any given integer <b>n</b> is the product of all the integers from 
        1 to n. Thus, the factorial of 5 is 120.
    </p>
    <p>5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4* 5 = 120</p>
    <p>We supply the recursive solution below along with a non-recursive one.</p>

    }
    return factorial;
