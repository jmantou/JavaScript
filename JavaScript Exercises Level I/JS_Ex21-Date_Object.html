	    <h1>JavaScript Exercise 21 - The Date Object</h1>
		<p>
			The <code>Date</code> object is a powerful object we can use to store precise time values
			down to the millisecond and translate between dates in different locales. We can also find
			the current date and time, store our own dates and times and do calculations with these dates down
			to the millisecond.
		</p>
		<p>
			To create a <code>Date</code> object we have to use the <code>new</code> operator. There is no literal
			date format so we have to use the constructor (new keyword). Whenever we create an empty instance,
			it reflects the exact moment at which it was created. You can use this technique to display
			current date and time on your web page.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are dozins of methods we can use with the <code>Date</code> object.

	var dt = new Date(); // Local Time and date of the computer used to access the page
    var month = dt.getMonth(); // Starts from 0 must be incremented
    var year = dt.getFullYear();
    var day = dt.getDate();
    var todayUTC = dt.toUTCString(); // UTC - Universal Greenwich Mean Time
    document.write(dt);
    document.write("<p>" + day + " / " + (month++) + " / " + year + "</p>" )
